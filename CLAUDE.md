# Skald — Claude Code Context

## What this project is
Skald is an AI-driven content pipeline producing daily European payments 
and open banking briefings. It ingests free news feeds, generates drafts 
via the Claude API, routes them through a Gradio editorial dashboard for 
human review and editing, and publishes to vikingmedia.org.

Built as a portfolio demonstration of prompt engineering discipline, 
editorial feedback loops, and the transition from human-edited to 
automated publication.

## Directory structure
```
/beats/          Beat config YAML files (one per topic)
/prompts/        System and story prompts (versioned YAML, one dir per beat)
/ingester/       Feed fetching and normalisation
/generator/      Claude API calls and draft production
/dashboard/      Gradio editorial interface
/output/         Generated drafts (Markdown, gitignored)
/data/feedback/  Edit diffs and quality scores (gitignored)
/site/           Hugo static site source
/docs/           Project documentation
```

## Key conventions
- Beat configs are YAML; schema defined in /beats/README.md
- Prompts are YAML files, never hardcoded in Python
- All Claude API calls go through generator/client.py — no direct API 
  calls elsewhere
- API keys via environment variables only (.env, never committed)
- /data/feedback/ is gitignored — do not add to version control
- /output/ is gitignored — generated files, not source files
- Commit messages: describe what was built and why, not just what changed

## APIs and services

## Current status
Early build phase. Directory structure and tooling being established.
